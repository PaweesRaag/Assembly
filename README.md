# 🛠️ Assembly Playground

Welcome to my Assembly language experiments and practice programs. This contains all the programs that you need to deeply understand in order to master Assembly (well not enough to code a kernel duh!! But enough to be a good Reverse Engineer). Use ChatGPT with my personal comments and follow along.
Also instead of compiling and linking multiple times use the makefile. Replace [Prog] with the program name and execute everything all at once 

## 🔧 Structure

- `basics/`: Fundamental programs
- `branching/`: Branching(If-else loops) examples
- `syscalls/`: Direct system call usage

## 💻 About

Built on Kali Linux using NASM and run via x86 architecture emulation.
